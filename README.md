<h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
	Hey pros. This is a clone of the legendary game called Flappy Bird. I made this to as a practice assignment for Unity. While developing this game, I learned a lot of things about working in Unity, implementation of C# in Unity and much more. Also, I used my ability of graphic designing by creating the logo for the game.
	P.S. I do not intend to take any credits of the sprites and music used in the game, since I do not own any of the them. Credits to their respective creators.
